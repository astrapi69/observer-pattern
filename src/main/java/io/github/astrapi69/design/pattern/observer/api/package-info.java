/**
 * Provides interfaces that define the core components of the observer design pattern
 *
 * <p>
 * The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object, known as the subject,
 * to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers, and notify them automatically of any
 * state changes, usually by calling one of their methods This package contains the fundamental
 * interfaces that are essential for implementing the observer pattern.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The key interfaces in this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.api.Observer} - Represents the observer
 * that watches the subject for changes</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.api.Subject} - Represents the subject
 * being observed</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.api.ActionCommand} - Represents a command
 * that can be executed, typically used by observers to respond to subject changes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These interfaces provide a flexible and extensible framework for implementing the observer
 * pattern in various contexts By adhering to these interfaces, developers can create systems where
 * objects can be notified of changes in other objects' states, promoting loose coupling and dynamic
 * behavior.
 * </p>
