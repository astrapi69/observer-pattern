/**
 * Provides interfaces and classes for implementing listeners in a chat application using the
 * observer design pattern
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is focused on defining the components necessary for handling events in a chat
 * system, specifically through the use of listeners Listeners are essential in the observer pattern
 * as they allow objects to be notified of events, such as incoming messages or changes in chat
 * state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The key interfaces and classes in this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.listener.MessageListener} -
 * Represents a listener that reacts to message events in the chat system</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.listener.MessageObject} -
 * Encapsulates the message event that is passed to listeners when a message is received</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.listener.MessageSource} - Represents
 * the source of messages, managing the registration of listeners and the firing of message
 * events</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package plays a crucial role in enabling dynamic communication between components in the
 * chat application by allowing objects to react to specific events It demonstrates how to use the
 * observer pattern to create responsive and interactive chat systems.
