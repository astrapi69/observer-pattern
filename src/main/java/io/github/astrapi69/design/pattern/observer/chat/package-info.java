/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for implementing a chat application using the observer design
 * pattern
 *
 * <p>
 * The chat package includes implementations of chat rooms, users, and messages, all of which
 * interact through the observer pattern This package demonstrates how to structure a chat system
 * where users can send and receive messages, and how those messages are propagated to all
 * participants in the chat room.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The key components of this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.ChatRoom} - Represents a chat room
 * where users can exchange messages</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.ChatRoomUser} - Represents a user
 * participating in a chat room</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.Message} - An interface for messages
 * sent within the chat room</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.StringMessage} - A concrete
 * implementation of {@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.Message} for text-based
 * messages</li>
 * <li>{@link io.github.astrapi69.design.pattern.observer.chat.User} - Represents a user entity in
 * the chat system</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The observer design pattern allows the chat application to notify all users in a chat room when a
 * new message is received This package demonstrates a flexible and extensible way to implement such
 * functionality using Java.
 * </p>
